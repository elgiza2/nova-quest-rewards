# Roadmap

- [x] Quick authenticated review: agents + opens chat draft, text response works, interactive question renders and its button sends the choice; settings, integrations, pricing and usage open. Removed auth-callback re-entry and history blocking from workspace loading; 100 existing tests and 2 new regression tests passed.
- [ ] External latency remains: specialist loading took 22–29 seconds and a widget required over 25 seconds; upstream generation/loading response time is not resolved by the workspace fix. Paid media, real payments and actual computer execution were not exercised in this quick review.

- [x] Allow computer app access, remove thinking/agent elapsed times, shrink drawn send buttons, and animate the central robot in button colors. Actual components checked at desktop/mobile sizes: no timing badges, 72×34px send action with 8px corners, 10 particles, no robot shadow; 19 tests passed.
- [ ] Authenticated live conversation check for this polish: user-managed sign-in prevents restoring a managed preview session; only actual presentation components were verified.

- [x] Fix streaming delays: direct answers release after prefix validation, received text renders without artificial reveal, and provider accounting runs after bytes are delivered; 25 focused tests passed.
- [x] Remove initial buffering for forced trivial fast turns; keep ordinary route-marker protection.
- [x] Restore readable thinking shimmer and expand live progress steps with elapsed time.
- [x] Strengthen interactive drawing/card/button instructions; verify renderer action callback.
- [x] Verified live answers with the test account: text starts in ~3s, glass widgets render.

- [x] Redesign Tasks with Orange point icon and five character images; restrict active tasks to the five requested types.
- [x] Remove main Agents +; remove Earn tasks and rename Earn to Referral with Telegram-only invite links.
- [x] Inline manual TON/USDT-TON checkout; strict reference matching and atomic settlement with transaction reuse prevention.
- [x] Synchronize returning Telegram profile photos and fullscreen/safe-area events; native Back navigation.
- [x] Remove visible old sharing/help branding; restore readable shimmering thinking text.
- [x] 13 targeted tests passed; public Tasks and inline Crypto navigation checked on mobile without runtime errors.
- [ ] Real transfer and authenticated read-back: unavailable without a real payment/session; other networks are disabled pending reliable verification.
- [ ] X follow and ORANGE purchase rewards: require X account verification and cryptographic wallet ownership proof; opening links never grants points.
- [ ] Verify fullscreen, native Back and profile image inside an actual Telegram client.
- [x] Chat drawings: gold/violet/blue/yellow tiles with the button glow and rising dots, comparisons drawn as tiles and bars instead of markdown tables; verified live with the test account.

- [x] Start message rewrite (bold, characters, community + buy ORANGE buttons), daily user notifications, Telegram-only login, full-screen Mini App with top safe area

- [x] Fast replies: skip out-of-credit text provider, use quick backup for simple chat (~1s)
- [x] Visual answers: model instructed to draw with built-in widget styling instead of OpenUI
- [ ] Images/video/files/code/computer in chat: blocked — Cerebras and abliteration accounts are out of credit (402/insufficient_credits), so the tool-capable agent cannot run

- [x] Remove other AI providers from main paths (leftover names in model lists/admin page still to clean)
